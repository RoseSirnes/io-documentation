# Clients 

On VTEX IO, Clients are **abstractions to other services**. 

Whenever you need to set up a connection with an external API or another VTEX service, you should create a Client in order to **focus on the real value of your software instead of worrying about those platform complexities**.

These are some of the features built in our clients infrastructure:

 - Cache ;
 - Native metrics support;
 - Retry and timeout options;
 - Billing tracking.
