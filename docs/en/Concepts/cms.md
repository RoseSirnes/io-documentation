CMS stands for Content Management System, which can be understood as a system that manages all the content consumed by one or several digital channels. 

In the VTEX scenario, CMS is the module responsible for managing the pages that build up your store's website.

Through the Admin interface, in the **Layout** section, it gives you the autonomy to create, organize, edit, and define the entire structure of folders, files, and components to make up your site front as desired using HTML and CSS.

## Store Framework and Site Editor

Another powerful resource at hand for you to create page content is the [VTEX Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-store-framework), which provides a foundation of highly flexible and customizable [React](https://reactjs.org/) components for any needed storefront structure.

The Store Framework solution enables non-tech users to be assisted by the Site Editor to perform updates in the storefront content. 

The Site Editor section, also found in the Admin's CMS module, reflects the account's Store Theme app. It works as a content editor for VTEX Store Framework users, providing support to edit the page's components as desired.
