# Pixel apps

This track will show you how to develop a [Pixel app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-pixel-app) that attends your store's particular needs.

- [Part 1. Setting up your development environment](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-2-basicsetuptodevelopinvtexio)
- [Part 2. Cloning the boilerplate repository](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-3-cloningtheboilerplaterepository)
- [Part 3. Configuring your app settings](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-4-configuringyourappsettings)
- [Part 4. Writing the header and body scripts](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-5-writingtheheaderandbodyscripts)
- [Part 5. Listening to store events](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-6-listeningtostoreevents)
- [Part 6. Structuring documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-7-structuringthedocumentation)
- [Part 7. Making your Pixel app publicly available](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-8-makingyourpixelapppubliclyavailable)

Several Pixel apps are already available through [VTEX Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-store-framework), ensuring that your store has the means to natively integrate with the main third party solutions available on the market. 

It is possible, however, that the integration you’re looking for is not currently available on the [Pixel apps list](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/pixel-apps/) that are ready to be installed. In such cases, you should **create your desired integration from scratch**.

>ℹ️ **Info**
>
>If you’re unsure whether to proceed with **developing a pixel app** or to **customize an HTML tag using Google Tag Manager**, keep in mind that the first option is always the most recommended. Developing an new app will enable a bold integration process with a third party solution, in addition to further evolving the Framework to help other users that may be interested in the same integration.
